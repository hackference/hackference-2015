										<p class="sponsor-desc" >Operating strictly as a business to business provider, the team of accountants and book keepers likes to focus on getting things done. They can handle year end accounts, tax returns and VAT returns quickly and cleanly, and with a minimum of fuss.</p>
										<p class="sponsor-desc" >Proactive has been running a paperless office since 1 April 2008. How did they do that? Well if you’ve met <a href='https://twitter.com/ProactivePaul'>@ProactivePaul</a> you’ll know he’s a coder on the side! Being paperless makes your relationship with the accountant quicker, easier and cheaper, which is surely something you’d be interested in!</p>
