	<h3>Death to Passwords</h3>
	<h4>Track 1</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>User authentication in mobile and web applications is a very common and integral use case. Implementing basic authentication is an easy solution for developers but comes with several pitfalls that impair user experience like (re-)entering passwords, the need to create a new unique password or even just the input of personal data on a flaky keyboard while registering a new account.</em></p>
	<p class="desc"><em>In this talk the security flaws and UX implications of passwords will be discussed and Tim will highlight which different techniques exist that are able to offer a more mobile friendly flow. Highlighting authorization and authentication techniques like OAuth, OpenID Connect and even hardware features like Bluetooth Low Energy this talk will be interesting for anyone who's facing a situation where creating and storing user accounts matters.</em></p>
