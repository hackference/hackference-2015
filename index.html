<div class="page-header">Hackference is coming back!</div>
<p><strong>Yes, that's right, Hackference will be back for a third year in a row.</strong></p>
<p>We're still a single day conference with a full weekend hackathon, for developers by developers. But this time we're mixing things up a bit to provide you with even more awesome!</p>
<p>The idea behind Hackference is to inspire people to develop more for fun. Software and app development is a day job for most attendees, Hackference is all about finding more stuff to enjoy and have fun and hack with.</p>
