	<h3>Super-Scalable Redis for Fun and Profit!</h3>
	<h4>Track 2</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>Redis is a notoriously fast, in-memory, Key/Value store widely used for building quick &amp; efficient Web Applications; but it has always had one major flaw - Scalabilty. In past times, the only way to scale Redis was Sharding - a difficult, time-consuming process. In this talk we'll cover Redis; working up from the basics, to building super-scalable systems using Redis' new Clustering capabilities.</em></p>
