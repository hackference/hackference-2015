	<h3>A little about Jonathan...</h3>
	<p class="desc">Hey, i'm Jon. I love to build software, hardware, break security and attend hackathons. I've worked on all kinds of projects, from games infrastructure to corporate systems to building RC Helis.</p>

	<h3>Fireworks As A Service: Building IoT devices with a Boom</h3>
	<h4>Track TBC</h4>
	<p class="desc"><em>Want to learn how to build physical hardware that can connect to the internet? Interested in fun electronic engineering projects? Just want to see some sh** blown up? Well, there's all that for you and more in this talk. MARVEL at the design process. STARE at the magnificently hacked-together C that runs it all. GASP in horror as you realise this will probably end up being more of a show-then-tell-then-explain than an actual informative talk. Overall, this should give you a pretty informative look into IoT devices, hardware hacking, securing API's and general fun when building crazy stuff.</em></p>
