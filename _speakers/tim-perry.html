	<h3>A little about Tim...</h3>
	<p class="desc">By day Tim Perry is a technical lead and the open-source champion at Softwire, guiding teams, building a variety of great software at every scale for Softwire's clients, and pushing Softwire to engage with and give back to the wider software development community. By night he's a prolific open-source contributor on huge variety of projects including Sinon.JS, Moment, Knockout & Lodash, along with some of his own such as loglevel and grunt-coveralls, and is feverishly keen on all things relating to automated testing, polyglot persistence, and good old-fashioned high-quality software development.</p>
