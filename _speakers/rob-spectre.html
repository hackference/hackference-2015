	<h3>A little about Rob...</h3>
		<p class="desc">Rob Spectre is a punk rock technolologist having a barrel of monkeys on the Internet.</p>
		<p class="desc">Doing just about anything for a good laugh, Rob serves the developer network at Twilio.  He is an ardent supporter of open source software and creative commons art, the startup scene in New York, and every professional sports club from Boston.  In addition to bringing the good news of Twilio to the world, Rob runs a number of exploits into Internet ridiculousness, including the robotic telephonic joke machine Laugh-o-Tron, the street art showcase Brooklyn Vandal, and the stage agnostic punk band Adventure Capitalists.</p>
		<p class="desc">Living and working in Brooklyn, Rob loves laughing, serving developers and failing to act his age by staying out of the most pit.</p>

		<h3>Why Rob?</h3>
		<p class="desc">Rob is our number one for being our conference keynote, for many reasons.</p>
